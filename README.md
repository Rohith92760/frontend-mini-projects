# 🎨 React Mini Projects — Color Picker, Mouse Tracker & Digital Clock

Hi there! 👋  
I'm **Rohith Pottabathini**, a passionate **Frontend Developer in learning** — exploring the world of **React.js** and modern web development.  

This repository contains **3 React mini-projects** I built to strengthen my understanding of React concepts such as `useState`, `useEffect`, and component-based architecture.  
Each project focuses on a specific React concept and helped me practice building interactive UIs.
